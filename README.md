Curve Editor--Graphics
====================

This project is a curve editor homework assignment for my Graphics course. The curve editor, using OpenGL, lets the user add, delete, move, or change various types of curves. A curve can be selected, which is indicated by whether it has larger control points and is blue.

* Curves
  * Bezier
  * Lagrange
  * PolyLine

* Usage (hold down the key)
  * 'b' - adds a Bezier Curve
  * 'l' - adds a Lagrange Curve
  * 'p' - adds a Polyline
  * 'a' - add a control point to the selected curve
  * 'd' - delete the clicked control point from the curve
